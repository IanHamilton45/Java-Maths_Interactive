2; Multiplication; To calculate the area of a triangle, multiply the height by the width (this is also known as the 'base') then divide by 2. Find the area of a triangle where height = 5cm and width = 8cm. 5 × 8 = 40 ÷ 2 = 20. The area is 20cm² work out the following where L = length and W= width A= area all measurements in cm² ; L=7 & W=8 = 28cm²; L=3 & w=6 = 8cm²; L=3 & w=8 = 9cm²; L=4 & w=8 = 16cm²;
3; Multiplication; To work out the area of a square or rectangle, multiply its height by its width. If the height and width are in cm, the area is shown in cm². If the height and width are in m, the area is shown in m².A square with sides of 5 m has an area of 25 m², because 5 × 5 = 25. work out the following where: H= 4 & W=6 = 24cm²; H= 3 & W=7 = 24cm² H= 7 & W=6 = 30cm²;  H= 4 & W=8 = 32cm²
4; Multiplication; Multiplying by 10 when a decimal is multiplied by  {10}, each digit moves one place to the left. What is 4.25 × 10? Each digit moves 1 place to the left, so 4.25 × 10 = 42.5. Work out the following: 3.2 x 10 = 32; 47.5 x 10 = 4.7; 2.12 x 10 = 21; 1.32 x 10 = 13.2;
5; Multiplication; When multiplying by  {100}, each digit moves two places to the left. What is 0.103 × 100? Each digit moves 2 places to the left. The zero at the front is no longer needed so we ignore it. Therefore 0.103 × 100 = 10.3; 0.23 x 100 = 23; 0.02 x 100 = 20; 0.12 x 100 = 1.2; 0.452 x 100 = 45.2;
