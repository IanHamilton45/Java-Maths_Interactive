1; Addition; Any number above zero is a positive number. Positive numbers are written with no sign or a ' {+}' sign in front of them and they are counted up from zero to the right on a number line. Any number below zero is a negative number. Negative numbers are always written with a ' {-}' sign in front of them and they are counted down from zero to the left on a number line. Always look at the sign in front of a number to see if it is positive or negative. Zero,  {0}, is neither positive nor negative.; -16 is lower than -2; -77 is higher than 77; 19 is lower than -20; 22 is higher than -22;
2; Addition; Rounding numbers:Top tip! If a number is less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up. Decimal places are counted from the decimal point. An example of a number rounded to two decimal places: 3.17 if the number that followed the 7 was higher than a 5 would it round up to 3.18. Something to remember! If you’re asked to round to 3 decimals and the number you have is 3.100076, the answer would be 3.100. Always remember to look at the number after the one you’re interested in.; 3.7686 = 3.77; 8.98000 = 8.97; 4.0012 = 4.00; 1.123 = 1.12;
3; Addition; Rounding numbers to the nearest 1, 10 or 100 can help with lots of mental maths problems. To add 9 to another number, add 10 and then subtract 1: 36 + 9 = 36 + 10 - 1 = 45. To add 18 to another number, add 20 and then subtract 2: 48 + 18 = 48 + 20 - 2 = 66. To add 97 to another number, add 100 and then subtract 3: 439 + 97 = 439 + 100 - 3 = 536 To add 0.9 to another number, add 1 and then subtract 0.1: 3.7 + 0.9 = 3.7 + 1 - 0.1 = 4.6; 9+96 = 105; 100+376= 435; 12+76=100; 13+270= 283
4; Addition; Breaking down numbers
5; Addition; Breaking down numbers can help you add or subtract in your head. For example: find the difference between 38 and 63. Count on from 38 to 40 and keep that 2 in your head.Now count on from 40 to 60, which is 20. Finally count from 60 to 63 which is 3. Add them together: 2 + 20 + 3 = 25. Work out the difference of the following numbers; 82 & 100 = 18; 12 & 22 = 8; 13 & 80 = 70; 14 & 90 = 76
6; Addition; follow the steps in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ujcg3HAyNY to learn how to use column addition. Key words - look out for these words in problems: total, sum, altogether, more. They all indicate an addition calculation.; 326+444= 770;2 30+900=760; 430+600=900; 760+280=1040;
7: Addition; Algebra is used in Maths when we do not know the exact number(s) in a calculation. In algebra we use letters to represent unknown values or values that can change. Algebra can be used in business when predicting sales, growth and profit. For example; For example, the formula for the area of a rectangle is b × h (b is the base and h is the height.) If the base was 3 cm and the height was 7 cm, then the area would be 21 cm². Workout the following, assuming A=8, B=6 and C=7: 3b+C= 25; 2a+C=11; a+b+2c= 12; a+c=15;
