1; Division; Dividing by 1, 10 or 100 When you divide by 1 the answer stays the same. 21 ÷ 1 = 21. When you divide by 10, move all the digits one place to the right. 210 ÷ 10 = 2. When you divide by 100, move all the digits two places to the right. 2100 ÷ 100 = 21; 21 ÷ 1= 21; 220 ÷ 10 =2.2; 33÷100 =3.3; 90 ÷ 100 = 0.9;
2; Division; dividing whole numbers is all aboutn trying to find out how to divide a number evenly for eg: 10 ÷ 2 = 5, 30 ÷ 5 = 6. The following questions are desinged to test you ability at dividing numbers quickly in your head; 9 ÷3 = 3; 25 ÷ 5 = 4; 30 ÷ 10 = 10; 20 ÷ 4 = 5;
3; Divsion; We can use either ÷ or / to symbolise a division. Division is the opposite of multiplying.  When we know a multiplication fact we can find a division fact: Example: 3 × 5 = 15, so 15 / 5 = 3. Also 15 / 3 = 5. Taking this into account work out the following numbers; 60 ÷ 3 = 20; 15 / 2 = 8; 14 ÷ 2 = 8; 81/ 9 = 9;
4; Division; There are special names for each number in a division: dividend ÷ divisor = quotient: Example: in 12 ÷ 3 = 4: 12 is the dividend: 3 is the divisor: 4 is the quotient. Work out the Divident, Divisor or quotient in the following sums: Question A; 12 / 4 = 3, Quesion B: 36 / 8 = 4.5; 4 = Divisor in A; 36 = quotient in B; 4.5 = dividend in B; 4.5 = quotient in B;
5; Division; Dividing by 10 When you divide by  10, each digit moves one place to the right. Hundreds become tens, tens become units, units become tenths and tenths become hundredths. Dividing by 10, What is 27 divided by 10? Each digit moves 1 place to the right. Therefore 27 ÷ 10 = 2.7. Work out the following: 23 / 10 = 2.3; 100/10 = 0.1; 380/10 = 3.8; 1000/ 10 = 100;
6; Division; Dividing by 100 When you divide by  {100}, each digit moves two places to the right. What is 2 divided by 100? Each digit moves 2 places to the right. We don't have any units and tenths, so we place a '0' in the columns. Therefore 2 ÷ 100 = 0.02; workout the following to show your understanding: 20 / 100 = 0.2; 3 / 100 = 0.3; 12 / 100 = 1.2; 4 / 100 = 0.04;
7; Division; Dividing by 1,000. When you divide by  {1,000}, each digit moves three places to the right. What is 30 divided by 1,000? Each digit moves 3 places to the right. We don't have any units and tenths, so we use '0' in each column. A zero in the thousandths column is not needed so we ignore it. Therefore 30 ÷ 1,000 = 0.03. Work out the following to show your understanding!; 60 / 1000 = 0.003; 76 / 100 = 00.76; 26/1000= 0.26; 3 / 1000 = 0.0003;
8; Division; Dividing a decimal by a whole number. In some cases its important to divide decimals by whole numbers follow this video for more support https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_NHrwK6ALE and answer the following questions: 6.009 / 5 = 1.2018; 3.007 / 3 = 0.7765; 4.008 / 6 = 0.6757; 5.002/4 = 1.2505;
