1; Subraction; Breaking down numbers. Breaking down numbers can help you add or subtract in your head. For example: find the difference between 38 and 63. Count on from 38 to 40 and keep that 2 in your head. Now count on from 40 to 60, which is 20. Finally count from 60 to 63 which is 3.Add them together: 2 + 20 + 3 = 25; 65-30 = 35; 62-20 = 24; 35-12 = 10; 60-28 = 32

3; Subtraction; Any number above zero is a positive number. Positive numbers are written with no sign or a ' {+}' sign in front of them and they are counted up from zero to the right on a number line. Any number below zero is a negative number. Negative numbers are always written with a ' {-}' sign in front of them and they are counted down from zero to the left on a number line. Always look at the sign in front of a number to see if it is positive or negative. Zero,  {0}, is neither positive nor negative.; -16 -2 = -18 ; -77 - 78 = 0 ; 19  -20 = 1; 22 -22 = 0;
